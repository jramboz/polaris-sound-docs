# Sound Fonts on Polaris
Putting a new [[Sound Fonts|sound font]] onto your Polaris is basically a two-step process:

1. [[Converting Sound Files for Polaris|Converting the sound font files to the format Polaris uses]]
2. [[Uploading Sound Files to Polaris|Uploading the files to your saber]]

While both steps are a little tricky and can be complex (especially for those with no background in these things), neither one is too difficult. It can, however, be be hard to figure out on your own and prone to fiddly errors--which is probably why you're reading this in the first place!

> [!note] A Reminder about Polaris
> I want to take this oportunity to remind you all that the Polaris and its Anima EVO electronics core are as much a labor of love as they are a product. They are built and maintained by people who believe in LudoSport and want it to have the tools it needs to be the best sport it can.
